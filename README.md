# url-search

Basic implemention of a tool that uses form input through AJAX to search a text based file (stored locally, files may include xml, vcl, txt etc.), finds all strings matching the input and converts the array to valid JSON. If the call is successful the JSON is formatted to convert strings to anchor links and output them to an ordered list.
